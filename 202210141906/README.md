# How to make a zettel entry

This is the body of the zettel (which means slips).

* First Bullet
* Second bullet

Ordered list or numbered list

1. First
2. Second
3. Third

```javascript

console.log("Hello World");
```


What if I want *italic* or **bold** or ***bolditalic***?

How about something that looks like `code`?

And when I have a URL I want it to print also I alway write it out like this:
